# Descriptive Data Mining - Apriori Algorithm

Introduction:

The descriptive and predictive data mining techniques are used in data mining to mine the types of patterns. The descriptive analysis is used to mine data and provide the latest information on past or recent events. Data mining tasks can be descriptive, predictive and prescriptive.

Among many descriptive data mining techniques, We performed Apriori Algorithm.

Apriori Algorithm:
Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning over relational databases. It proceeds by identifying the frequent individual items in the database and extending them to larger and larger item sets as long as those item sets appear sufficiently often in the database.

DataSet: Contact Lenses:
Our purpose is to determine factors that lead to a patient receiving or not receiving a contact lens prescription. 

We made inferences and used WEKA for implementing the project.
